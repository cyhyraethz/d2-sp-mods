### Installation

1. Backup your single player save files, which should be located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II\Save` for all patches up to 1.13d, or in `C:\Users\your-username\Saved Games\Diablo II` for patch 1.14.

   Then backup your Diablo II game folder, which should be located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II`.

2. Download the most recent release from the [releases page](https://github.com/cyhyraethz/d2-sp-mods/releases) and extract the files.

3. Copy the files from the 1.13c folder into your Diablo II game folder, replacing existing files.

   If you're downgrading from patch 1.14, copy the MpqFixer folder into your Diablo II game folder. Then navigate into the MpqFixer folder, right click on FIX_MPQS_RUN_AS_ADMIN.bat, and select "Run as administrator".

4. Copy the files from the ModPack folder into your Diablo II game folder.

5. Run the VideoFix.reg file to edit your registry, or follow the instructions below to do it manually.

6. Start the game with PlugY.exe as administrator, which is the executable you will now be using for launching the game. I recommend setting it to always run as administrator by right clicking PlugY.exe, selecting `Properties`, going to the `Compatibility` tab, and checking the `Run this program as an administrator` box.

### Troubleshooting

Try the following steps if you have trouble getting the game working with cnc-ddraw.

Windows:

- Right click on start, select run, type regedit, and hit enter to open Registry Editor
- Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Blizzard Entertainment\Diablo II\VideoConfig`
- Right click on `Render`, select `modify`, then change the value to 0

Linux:

- Select Diablo II in Lutris
- Open `Wine configuration` and select the `Libraries` tab
- Type ddraw into the `New override for library:` box
- Click `Add`, select `Yes`, then click `OK`

### How to Use Loot Filter

No items are hidden by loot filter with default settings.

To change loot filter settings:

- Ctrl click on `Settings` to open panel
- Left click on the `Item` tab near top of panel

From there you can adjust the filter level and ping level.

I recommend keeping it on filter level 0 for new characters.

At higher levels it can be useful to change filter level to 1 or 2.

A brief explanation of filter levels:

- 0: Nothing is filtered at this level so all item drops are visible on the ground
- 1: Filter many white and blue items, small gold piles, low level potions, scrolls, etc
- 2: Same as 1 but with no notifications for Flawless Amethysts, Ral Runes, or Hel Runes
- 3: Filter all white, blue, and rare items not whitelisted (use at your own risk)

Ping level controls item drop notifications, lower being more strict.

I recommend ping level 6 when first starting out for the most noficiations.

Later on it may be useful to reduce it to ping level 4 or 5 to get less notifications.

You can use ping level 3 or lower if you only want to get notifications for high end items.

### Additional Notes

Diablo Clone can be spawned by selling a Stamina Potion in Hell Difficulty.

Drop rates are unaltered and maphack is disable in the config files by default.

If you would prefer to play with improved drop rates you can:

- Enable Linear MF in BaseMod.ini to remove diminishing returns on Magic Find
- Enable Perfect Drop in BaseMod.ini to force all items to drop perfect and repaired

If you would prefer to play using maphack you can enable these features:

- Reveal Map, Show Monsters, Show Missiles, Show Chests, Force Light Radius
- Remove Weather, Infravision, Display Level Names, Draw Path, Draw Destination

Maphack features can be enabled and disable by ctrl clicking on Settings in-game.

### Warning

Items may be lost if character is used in a game with standard inventory size.
