### Installation

1. Backup your characters and the game folder before making any changes.

2. Download the most recent release from the [releases page](https://github.com/cyhyraethz/d2-sp-mods/releases) and extract the files.

3. If you're not already using patch 1.13c, copy the files from the extracted 1.13c folder into the game folder, which should be located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II`, replacing existing files.

4. If you're downgrading from patch 1.14, copy your existing save folder, which should be located in `C:\Users\username\Saved Games\Diablo II`, into the game folder and rename it "Save".

5. Copy the files from the extracted Diablo II folder into the game folder, merging and replacing as needed.

6. Start the game with PlugY.exe as administrator, which is the executable you will now be using for launching the game. I recommend setting it to always run as administrator by right clicking PlugY.exe, selecting `Properties`, going to the `Compatibility` tab, and checking the `Run this program as an administrator` box.

### Troubleshooting

Try the following steps if you have trouble getting the game working with cnc-ddraw

Windows:

- Open Registry Editor by right clicking `Start`, selecting `Run`, and executing regedit

- Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Blizzard Entertainment\Diablo II\VideoConfig`

- Change the value of `Render` to 0

Linux:

- Select Diablo II in Lutris

- Open `Wine configuration` and select the `Libraries` tab

- Type ddraw into the `New override for library:` box

- Click `Add`, select `Yes`, then click `OK`

### Notes

Diablo Clone can be spawned by selling a Stamina Potion in Hell Difficulty

Drop rates are unaltered and maphack is disable in the config files by default

If you would prefer to play with improved drop rates you can:

- Enable Linear MF in BaseMod.ini to remove diminishing returns on Magic Find

- Enable Perfect Drop in BaseMod.ini to force all items to drop perfect and repaired

If you would prefer to play using maphack you can enable these features:

- Reveal Map, Show Monsters, Show Missiles, Show Chests, Force Light Radius

- Remove Weather, Infravision, Display Level Names, Draw Path, Draw Destination

Maphack features can be enabled and disable by ctrl clicking on Settings in-game

### Warning

Items may be lost if character is used in a game with standard inventory size
