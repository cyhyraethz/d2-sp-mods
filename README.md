## Installation

1. Backup your Diablo II installation and your Save folder before making any changes

2. Download the most recent release from the [releases page](https://github.com/cyhyraethz/d2-sp-mods/releases)
   and extract the files

3. If you're not already using patch 1.13c, copy all the files from the 1.13c folder
   into your Diablo II installation folder (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II),
   replacing existing files

4. Copy all the files from the extracted Diablo II folder into your Diablo II
   installation folder, merging directories and replacing files as needed

5. Start the game with PlugY.exe, which is the executable you will now be using
   for launching the game

## Notes

Diablo Clone can be spawned by selling Stamina Potion to vendor in Hell Difficulty

## Warning

Items may be lost if character is used in a game with standard inventory size
