--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Patch 1.13a (Public Test Realm)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Patch 1.12
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Downloadable Installer Support

- If all required Diablo 2 '.MPQ' files are installed on the
  hard drive, the game will no longer require the CD to play. 

   For users that originally performed a 'Full Installation' 
   and wish to run without the CD, all '.MPQ' files should 
   be copied from the Diablo 2 CDs to the Diablo 2 directory.  
   Most users will only need to copy D2Music.mpq from the 
   Diablo 2 Play CD and/or D2xMusic.mpq from the Lord of 
   Destruction CD.  Mac users will need to copy these music 
   files and rename them to 'Diablo II Music' and 
   'Diablo II Expansion Music' respectively. 

   Anyone who did not perform a 'Full Installation' will need
   to re-install from CD again to ultimately play without the CD.  
   In this case, a 'Full Installation' is required, followed by file 
   copy step noted above.

     Minor Bugs

  as a Windows Service.  -install is now ignored.
- Sometimes the seals in Diablo's lair would not activate.  This has been
  corrected.
- Character expiration messages have been updated to reflect the
  expiration policy implemented in patch 1.10.

  items the player does not have.  This has been corrected.

  one or two characters.
- When leaving a game on Battle.net, you will now be brought back to the
  channel in which you were previously.
- Transmuting an ethereal item now retains the ethereal stats bonuses.
- In Japanese Lord of Destruction, items that add to all Assassin skills

  die nearby.

  players from subsequently declaring hostility and having the hammers hit
  other players for damage.
- Set items retained their multi-piece bonuses after the player died, even
  though they were removed.  This has been corrected.
- Items with skill-charging effects will no longer give synergy bonuses to
  skills when equipped on a character without those skills.

  with more than one dash or underscore in their name.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Patch 1.10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

   
     Mysterious World-event 

- Players of Hell difficulty Realm games are hereby warned that a new,
  challenging world-event has been added to Diablo II version 1.10.
  Players of Hardcore characters should be even more wary when
  encountering Superunique monsters during an active world event. Be
  prepared to execute a hasty Save and Exit, if your situation seems too
  dangerous.


     Fundamental architecture changes/improvements

- The skill and monster systems are now completely data-driven. Skill
  balancing is simpler and quicker.  Monster control/populating/creation
  is simpler. Although done for our needs, mod-makers should like these
  changes, too. A major result is that nearly any skill can be used by any
  character class.
- A skill now may have synergy Bonuses (similar to masteries) applied by
  putting points into other skills.
- The player stats and inventory system has been completely redone to
  run more efficiently, improving server performance and stability.
- The collision detection system has been sped up significantly. Again,
  improving server performance.


     Specific changes/improvements

- Increased difficulty for high-level players to reduce future
  exploitation of the game system.
- Made monsters tougher
- Beefed up monster difficulty in Act V, Nightmare, and Hell
  difficulties. This was accomplished by improving monster stats (hp, ac,
  etc.) and by boosting their AI/behavior in NM and Hell difficulties
  (that is, by making decisions more often and by simply moving faster).
  In Nightmare and Hell difficulties monster damages have generally been
  increased -- dramatically in some cases.
- Reduced the effectiveness of Experience runs, power-leveling, and
  leeching.
- Added randomized (especially ranged-attack) monsters to Nightmare and
  Hell Act V - e.g., Burning Dead, Imps, etc.
- Increased the Experience attached to most Act V monsters in Normal,
  Nightmare, & Hell difficulties.
- Reduced the HP of (Act V) Barbarian soldiers in Nightmare and Hell
  difficulties.
- Increased the rate of occurrence of Unique monsters in Hell
  difficulty.
- Reduced the party member Experience sharing to 0 beyond a maximum
  distance of about 2 screens from the monster death. This prevents
  low-level characters from joining a party and then staying completely
  out of harm's way while still getting Experience.
- Increased the Experience penalty for Clvl 70+ as follows: Clvl 1 - 69:
  100% Experience Clvl 70 - 99: 85% - 0.8% Experience (approximately
  exponential decaying)
- Encouraged players to play in more of the Diablo II
  areas/locations/levels.
- Reduced drops from the most-run SuperUnique monsters, ThreshSocket and
  Pindleskin.
- Cut Experience and reduced drops in the Cow level.
- Randomized the monster populations more thoroughly throughout Act V in
  Nightmare and Hell difficulties, including the addition of 'guest
  monsters' from other Acts.
- Increased the number of Unique monsters in each area and difficulty.

    
    Improved various Items

- Improved the attributes for newly-dropped Rare Armor, Helms, and most
  Weapons.
- Added over 100 new Unique Items, of which 29 can be found only in
  Ladder games.

  Hostility and doing immediate damage to the unsuspecting.
- Prevented 3rd-party hacks from treating background objects as a
  Waypoint.
- Enforced a 10-second delay between declaring Hostility and using a
  Waypoint or Town Portal to leave town.
- Ears and other items dropped on the ground by players (even in town)
  are deleted more frequently, and even when on the same screen as
  players.  Magic, Rare, Set, and Unique items persist longer.

  game without entering chat.
- Added the ability to recover a forgotten/stolen account password via
  email registration.
- Added a new command '/mail account_name' which sends a message
  directly to the account's registered email address.
- An 'expiration date' is now shown with Realm Characters on the
  selection screen.
- Introduced a new Ladder System for those who prefer to play free from
  any characters who may have participated in past item duping or hacking.
  To use this new feature, a player places a check in the Ladder box upon
  character creation -- in the same way that Expansion and Hardcore
  selection is done. Periodically, the Ladder may be reset, adding the old
  Ladder characters to the regular population -- who, of course, cannot
  play games with the new season's Ladder characters. Thus, every season
  each new Ladder character truly starts from scratch, as no 'twinking' is
  possible from older characters.
- Once a player defeats Diablo, all Diablo II Battle.net accounts
  accessed from that computer may create Hardcore characters.

   
     Battle.net bugs

- Prevented a crash when waiting in the Blizzard Tech Support channel on
  Battle.net.

  Hardcore, the character icon now properly appears in both chat and the
  Character Selection Screen.

  to masquerade as official Blizzard accounts.

  chat rooms.

  had been designated as the operator of a private channel resigns.

  they have been banned.
- Barbarians dual-wielding with a Javelin now show the Javelin in
  battle.net chat, too.
- Removed Age from the Player Profile.

  as nearly invincible, that is, with < 0 hit points.

  amount.

  the target.

  and establishing the waypoint in the Valley of the Magi. (Act II).

----------------------------------------------------------------
- patch 1.01
----------------------------------------------------------------

      Major bugs

- Fixed a bug that prevented you from getting credit for killing a
  quest boss, if you died before it did -- perhaps, by killing it
  with a poisoned weapon.
- Fixed a bug that could crash the game during the countdown after
  completing the final quest in Act IV, if the player used
  Waypoints to return to the earlier Acts.
- Fixed a hang bug that could occur if picking up gold while
  fleeing from a Gargantuan Beast (Act I).
- Fixed a crash bug that very rarely occurred when a Sorceress
  cast the Meteor spell.
- Fixed the "black screen" crash that could occur if one pressed
  'Alt-tab' during a cinematic.
- A Multiplayer Install running DirectDraw will no longer crash
  when one cancels the Cinematic selection menu.
- Fixed a bug that prevented two quest rewards from scaling up
  properly for Nightmare and Hell difficulty.
- Sand Leaper corpses no longer prevent players from moving through
  a tight pass in the Act II desert.
- Wounded Act II spiders no longer greatly reduce the frame rate.
- Lower-titled characters may now join Open games created by
  higher-titled characters (those who have completed the game in
  Normal, Nightmare, or Hell difficulty).
- Fixed a bug that prevented some complete Item Sets from having
  their full bonus.
- Fixed a bug in Open Battle.net games that allowed a second player
  to create another game with the same name as an already existing
  game. No one could join the second one.
- Fixed a bug in TCP/IP games when a Town Portal was smothered in
  piles of gold, it could cause a player entering from the other
  end of the Portal to be disconnected from the Host.
- Fixed a bug that prevented interacting with the Stash, NPCs, or
  Waypoints if the player clicked on the Stash, then pressed 'H'
  before arriving at the Stash, and finally pressed 'H' again
  after arriving at the Stash.

      Minor bugs

- Removed an unused gossip from Ormus (Act III).
- Fixed a bug where if the 'Space bar' were assigned to another
  function, it would erroneously continue to close the Message Log,
  Quest Log, and Waypoint menu.
- Fixed a bug that occasionally allowed some monsters to enter the
  Act II town of Lut Gholein.

      Improvements

- Improved the stability of the servers and the behavior of clients
  when a server malfunctions.
- Changed the amount of gold dropped by a player who is killed by
  another player (PKed) to equal the amount that would normally be
  lost "to the void" as a death penalty when killed by a monster.
- Updated the ReadMe.htm to document the PK gold-drop penalty.
- Changed the text color for Blizzard Representatives in Diablo II
  chat rooms to yellow.
- Australian users connect to the USWest Realm instead of the Asia
  Realm.

******Game Hints/Spoilers******

- Fixed a crash bug that occurred upon entering the red Portal to
  the Canyon of the Magi, if a player had completed the Arcane
  Sanctuary quest, then saved and started a new game, before
  completing the Seven Tombs quest (Act II).
- Fixed a multiplayer bug that prevented a character from completing
  the final quest in Act II (and advancing to Act III), when joining
  a game started by a character who had already defeated the final
  boss, but who had not yet visited Meshif for the reward.
- Fixed the following 3 bugs that could occasionally crash the game:
  - Killing Lord De Seis (Act IV).
  - In Perspective mode Glide entering a Tomb in the Canyon
    of the Magi (Act II).
  - A multiplayer party fighting in the Kurast Bazaar (Act III).
- Fixed a bug that caused a quest item being held in the cursor to
  disappear when pressing the Horadric Cube's transmute button.
